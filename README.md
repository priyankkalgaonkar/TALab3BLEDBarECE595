# Lab 3 - Grove LED Bar Experiment 
## Introduction
Grove LED Bar is comprised of a 10 segment LED gauge bar and an MY9221 LED controlling chip. The example for the Grove shield uses the Grove LED Bar on D5 connector (D6/D5 pins). This program raises the bar from 0 to 10. It can be used as an indicator for remaining battery life, voltage, water level, music volume or other values that require a gradient display. There are 10 LED bars in the LED bar graph: one red, one yellow, one light green, and seven green bars. The example lights up the LEDs sequentially from red to green, so the entire bar graph is lit up in the end.

Replace the default code with the code in "main.cpp" from this GitHub repo by creating an empty project OR clone the GitHub code in to your Keil Studio Cloud IDE (recommended).
